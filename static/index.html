      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Turtles VS Dragons! This game is a side scrolling version of
        Space Invaders! It's up to you to stop those evil dragons from destroying
        the entire swamp on the turtles. Use your magic bullets to destroy as many
        of them as you can!
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <p>Above the game window you will see different buttons and game information.
        The dropdown menu will let you select what kind of background you would like
        to see when shooting the dragons. Nothing special happens besides just changing
        how things look. You can also choose to open up the instructions again if you 
        forgot how to do something. 
      </p>

        For this game, you will start with 20 lives. Every time you kill a certain amount
        of dragons your life counter will increase. However, this will only increase up to
        a certain point. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Your score is also determined by how many dragons you kill. As you kill more dragons,
        you will eventually hit checkpoints that will increase how many points you will earn.
        However, you this will only increase up to a certain point.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>In addition to see the amount of points and lives you have, you will also be able
        to see how many dragons you have killed. If you play enough you will be able to tell
        just how many dragons you need to kill before you hit each checkpoint. However, as 
        you gain bonuses for the amount of dragons you kill, they dragons speed and the 
        frequency they spawn at will also increase.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls:</h2>
      <p>The controls are pretty simple for this game. W is up, S is down, A is left, and D is right.
        You can only go a certain distance to your left, but as you move around don't be surpised if 
        something unexpected happens. Oh and before I forget, just hit the spacebar if you want to 
        shoot the dragons. Good Luck!
